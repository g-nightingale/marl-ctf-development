## The Surprising Effectiveness of PPO in Cooperative Multi-Agent 
### Summary
- The authors empirically demonstrate that with simple modifications, PPO can achieve strong performance in a wide variety of cooperative

### Architecture
### Key results
- More info can be passed to critic network during training, as the critic network is not used during inference.


### COMA
- Counterfactual analysis (or counterfactual thinking) explores outcomes that did not actually occur, but which could have occurred under different conditions
